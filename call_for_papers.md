## Special issue on IoT Systems, Services and Analytics for Developing Worlds for the Vietnam Journal of Computer Science

### Introduction

Developing worlds today face several problems w.r.t. resources and environment management, transportation management, healthcare, to name just a few, that require novel, efficient and cost-effective solutions. In parallel, advanced in mobile devices, Internet of Things (IoT) and cloud services have introduced viable technologies that enable the development of novel solutions solving these problems in developing worlds. Smart devices and their capacity easily connect to the Internet and data centers for information gathering, sharing and analytics that allows us to monitor, predict, control and manage several aspects of physical worlds. They provide powerful tools to enable us to solve critical problems in developing worlds, such as pollution of water/land/air, healthcare, food safety, city traffic, and wastewater management. However, due to unreliable communications, lack of computation resources, cost effective, easy to use, light integration and very large-scale, apply the IoT solutions in those countries to be more difficult and usually have different characteristics.

This special issue will focus on novel systems, services and analytics centered around IoT and cloud technologies for developing worlds. It follows the 2016 International Symposium on IoT Systems, Services and Analytics for Developing Worlds (ISSA-DW2016), 4-5 Aug 2016, Hanoi, Vietnam. Authors of accepted extended abstracts and presentations at ISSA-DW2016 are invited to submit their full papers for this special issue. Other prospective authors are also encouraged to submit their novel solutions for developing worlds to this special issue.
