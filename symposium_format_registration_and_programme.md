---

**Our goal is to  enable scientific discussion and networking but low-entry cost for scientists from developing worlds.**

In this edition, the symposium will have both scientific and industrial tracks. The symposium will be held as a single-track programme. The scientific track will include keynotes from academics and scientific works, whereas the industrial track will include talks from industries, start-up ideas, and demonstration. A panel will also be organized to discuss research directions  and challenging problems in services and analytics for developing worlds.

The first symposium will provide **free registration**. Lunch will be provided free for presenters and invited speakers. A social dinner will be organized for interested participants (with fee).
