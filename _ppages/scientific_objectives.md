Developing worlds today face several problems w.r.t. resources and environment management, healthcare that require novel, efficient and cost-effective solutions. In parallel, advanced in mobile devices, Internet of Things (IoT) and cloud services have introduced viable technologies that  enable the development of novel solutions solving these problems in developing worlds.  Smart devices and their capacity easily connect to the Internet and data centers for information creation, sharing and analytics that allows us to monitor, predict and control the physical world. This is opportunity for us to solve critical problems in developing worlds, such as pollution of water/land/air, healthcare, food safety, transportation, etc. However, due to unreliable communications, lack of computation resources, cost effective, easy to use, light integration and very large-scale, apply the IoT solutions in those countries to be more difficult and usually have different characteristics. The objectives of the symposium are to foster research collaboration, exchange and dissemination of scientific work in developing worlds. 

**The encouraging topics of submission are as follows:**

* Design, monitoring and testing techniques for IoT systems in developing worlds.
* Smart e-service models and techniques for developing worlds due to unwell-developed IT infrastructures.
* IoT and Data Analytics in developing worlds (considering highly unstable environments and cost issues).
* Cross issues in IoT services and analytics, such as security, privacy, legals, data collection and sharing.
* IoT Applications in smart cities, smart agriculture, transportation, and healthcares in developing worlds.

**Key principles for scientific works presented in the symposium:**

* Design and engineering for developing worlds: they must work in developing worlds, use cases and solutions for developing worlds.
* Novel or adopted from developed worlds.
* Joint works between scientists in developed and developing worlds.
