## Scientific Objectives

Developing worlds today face several problems w.r.t. resources and environment management, healthcare that require novel, efficient and cost-effective solutions. In parallel, advanced in mobile devices, Internet of Things (IoT) and cloud services have introduced viable technologies that  enable the development of novel solutions solving these problems in developing worlds.  Smart devices and their capacity easily connect to the Internet and data centers for information creation, sharing and analytics that allows us to monitor, predict and control the physical world. This is opportunity for us to solve critical problems in developing worlds, such as pollution of water/land/air, healthcare, food safety, transportation, etc. However, due to unreliable communications, lack of computation resources, cost effective, easy to use, light integration and very large-scale, apply the IoT solutions in those countries to be more difficult and usually have different characteristics. The objectives of the symposium are to foster research collaboration, exchange and dissemination of scientific work in developing worlds.

**The encouraging topics of submission are as follows:**

* Design, monitoring and testing techniques for IoT systems in developing worlds.
* Smart e-service models and techniques for developing worlds due to unwell-developed IT infrastructures.
* IoT and Data Analytics in developing worlds (considering highly unstable environments and cost issues).
* Cross issues in IoT services and analytics, such as security, privacy, legals, data collection and sharing.
* IoT Applications in smart cities, smart agriculture, transportation, and healthcares in developing worlds.

**Key principles for scientific works presented in the symposium:**

* Design and engineering for developing worlds: they must work in developing worlds, use cases and solutions for developing worlds.
* Novel or adopted from developed worlds.
* Joint works between scientists in developed and developing worlds.

## Registration

**Our goal is to  enable scientific discussion and networking but low-entry cost for scientists from developing worlds.**

In this edition, the symposium will have both scientific and industrial tracks. The symposium will be held as a single-track programme. The scientific track will include keynotes from academics and scientific works, whereas the industrial track will include talks from industries, start-up ideas, and demonstration. A panel will also be organized to discuss research directions  and challenging problems in services and analytics for developing worlds.

The first symposium will provide **free registration**. Lunch will be provided free for presenters and invited speakers. A social dinner will be organized for interested participants (with fee).

## Submission and Publication

The symposium calls for working papers. Authors should submit an extended abstract (maximum 3 pages in Springer style) by the deadline through easychair.  Accepted abstracts and slides will be made available in the website. All accepted working papers in the symposium will be invited to submit a full paper for considering in a special issue in the [Vietnam Journal of Computer Science](http://link.springer.com/journal/40595). This issue will publish 5-6 papers.  The editors of this special issue will be **Hong-Linh Truong, Nanjangud Narendra, and Aditya Ghose.**
